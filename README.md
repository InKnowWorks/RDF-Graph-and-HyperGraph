# RDF Graph, HyperGraph and Property Graph Data Model design and Programming for GraphEngine MemoryClould Knowledge-base Development
Exploration, teaching and learning of RDF Graph and HyperGraph Data Modeling using Microsoft GraphEngine TSL, Computed DSL, LIKQ and APIs.
Here you'll find demo solutions sourced from Visual Studio 2022, projects written in C# 10.x; explore .NET Core Console, WPF/winUi/MAUI projects that explain Data Modeling of RDF (Directed/Multi Graph), Property Graph and HyperGraph productions using the Microsoft GraphEngine and it's TSL modeling language.

* Draft of a new book - Microsoft Graph Engine Developer's Guide - (In Progress)
* First 4 chapters are nearly complete; I just need to figure out the book publishing things. I've never written a book before so this is a new experience and I expect to learn a lot.

Topics Explored and Explained:
- RDF Triple and Graph Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and HyperGraph Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and MultiGraph / Property Grpah Theory and Practice
