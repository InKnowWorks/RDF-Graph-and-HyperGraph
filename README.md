# RDF Graph, HyperGraph and Property Graph Data Model design and Programming for GraphEngine MemoryClould Knowledge-base Development
Exploration, teaching and learning of RDF Graph and HyperGraph Data Modeling using Microsoft GraphEngine TSL, Computed DSL, LIKQ and APIs.
Here you'll find demo solutions sourced from Visual Studio 2019, projects written in C# 8.x; explore .NET Core 3.x Console, WPF projects that explain Data Modeling of RDF (Directed/Multi Graph), Property Graph and HyperGraph productions using the Microsoft GraphEngine and it's TSL modeling language.

* Draft of a new book - Microsoft Graph Engine Developer's Guide - (In Progress)
