# RDF Graph, HyperGraph and Property Graph Data Model design and Programming for GraphEngine MemoryClould Knowledge-base Development
Exploraton, teaching and learning of RDF Graph and HyperGraph Data Modeling using Microsoft GraphEngine TSL, Computed DSL, LIKQ and APIs.
Here you'll find demo solutions sourced from Visual Studio 2019, projects written in C# 8.x; explore .NET Core 3.x Console, WPF projects that explain Data Modeling of RDF (Directed/Multi Graph), Property Graph and HyperGraph productions using the Microsoft GraphEngine and it's TSL modeling language.

Topics Explored and Explained:
- RDF Triple and Graph Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and HyperGrpah Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and Property Graph Theory and Practice
- RDF/RDFS TSL Data modeling
- Relational Modeling and Computing with RDF Triple GrpahEngine MemoryCloud
- How to model OWL 2 DL projects in TSL - Getting started

- SPARQL vs LIKQ Comparision Study
- Graph Egnine Programming Idioms for Search
- BFS, BackTracking, Blocking
- Rule Processing via Dynamic Lambda Injection
- Generic Programming with the GE (Server-side)
- Generic Programming with Attribute Mark-up with the GE (Server and Client)
