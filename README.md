# RDF Graph, HyperGraph and Property Graph Data Model design and Programming for GraphEngine MemoryClould Knowledge-base Development
Exploraton, teaching and learning of RDF Graph and HyperGraph Data Modeling using Microsoft GraphEngine TSL, Computed DSL, LIKQ and APIs.
Here you'll find demo solutions sourced from Visual Studio 2017, projects written in C# 7.x; explore Console, WPF and UWP projects that explain Data Modeling of RDF (Directed Graph), Property Graph and HyperGraph productions using the Microsoft GraphEngine and it's TSL modeling language.

Topics Explored and Explained:
- RDF Triple and Graph Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and HyperGrpah Theory and Practice
- RDF Triple and Property Graph Theory and Practice

GraphEngine Deep Drives:
- GraphEngine programming models
- GraphEngine and the Azure Service Fabric
- Graph Discovery and Exploration
- GraphEngine Language Integrated Knowledge Query (LIKQ)
